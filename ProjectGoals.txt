The goal is of this project is to ElasticSearch's API to make it .NET friendly.

These assemblies should lend themselves as the foundation for 
tools for the analysis, use, or abstraction of elastic search.
These should promote ElasticSearch as a valid tool for .NET users with minimal 
work needed to actually understand the internal workings of ElasticSearch.

All IUriProvider constructor injections will expect the ES cluster URI: http://{cluster}:9200/


Eventually i would like to stop people from building a request that can't work
	- a geo_distance filter requires the field it searches against to be a geo_point
		- i can check the mapping to make sure the field really is a geo_point
